# Next Steps for Search++

## 1. Core Functionality Enhancements

### Improve Embedding Context
- [ ] Include docstrings and comment blocks in the embeddings for richer semantic context
- [ ] Add support for extracting important information from JSDoc/TSDoc comments
- [ ] Implement a smarter hierarchical context system that includes function parameters and return types
- [ ] Add support for extracting semantic information from specific frameworks (React components, Angular services, etc.)

### Enhance Search Quality
- [ ] Implement semantic re-ranking using an LLM to improve result relevance
- [ ] Add support for filters (by file type, directory, etc.) in the UI
- [ ] Create a simple relevance feedback system (thumbs up/down on results)
- [ ] Support for advanced query syntax (e.g., "function:validateUser" to target functions only)

### Token-Aware Processing
- [ ] Implement intelligent chunking based on token limits
- [ ] Add progress indicators for large codebase indexing
- [ ] Improve handling of large files and oversized symbols

## 2. User Experience Improvements

### Configuration and Settings
- [ ] Add configurable settings through VS Code's settings.json:
  - Embedding model selection
  - Max search results
  - Exclusion patterns
  - Indexing frequency
- [ ] Create a dedicated settings page in the extension

### UI Enhancements
- [ ] Implement syntax highlighting for code previews in search results
- [ ] Add a history of recent searches
- [ ] Create saved/favorite searches functionality
- [ ] Add a "Share this search" feature that generates a permalink
- [ ] Improve the result display with better context and navigation options
- [ ] Add dark/light theme support for the custom webview

## 3. Performance Optimizations

### Indexing Improvements
- [ ] Implement incremental updates (only embed changed portions of files)
- [ ] Add a scheduled background indexing option
- [ ] Support partial workspace indexing for very large codebases
- [ ] Add an index statistics view (tokens used, files indexed, etc.)

### Backend Optimizations
- [ ] Add support for local embedding models to reduce API usage
- [ ] Implement batched embedding requests for more efficient API usage
- [ ] Add caching strategies for frequently used queries
- [ ] Optimize ChromaDB usage with filtering and metadata queries

## 4. Developer Experience

### Error Handling and Logging
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase
- [ ] Implement a logging system with configurable verbosity
- [ ] Create a diagnostics view for troubleshooting embedding issues
- [ ] Add telemetry options (opt-in) for improving the extension

### Testing and Reliability
- [ ] Add unit tests for critical components
- [ ] Create integration tests for the complete search workflow
- [ ] Add automated tests for the Python embedding server
- [ ] Implement reliability metrics and monitoring

## 5. Extensibility

### API and Integration Points
- [ ] Create a clean API for other extensions to use Search++ capabilities
- [ ] Add support for custom embedding providers through plugins
- [ ] Support for integration with other VS Code features (e.g., Problems panel)
- [ ] Add export/import functionality for sharing embeddings between workspaces

### Multi-language Support
- [ ] Improve language-specific context extraction for popular languages
- [ ] Add specialized handling for documentation languages (Markdown, RST)
- [ ] Support for natural language queries in multiple languages

## 6. Documentation and Community

### User Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive user documentation
- [ ] Add detailed configuration guides
- [ ] Create examples of effective search strategies
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guides

### Developer Documentation
- [ ] Document the architecture and design decisions
- [ ] Add API documentation for extension points
- [ ] Create contribution guidelines
- [ ] Add code of conduct and governance documents

## 7. Deployment and Distribution

### Packaging
- [ ] Optimize the extension size for faster downloads
- [ ] Improve the Python dependency management
- [ ] Create a more streamlined first-run experience

### Marketing
- [ ] Create a project website or documentation site
- [ ] Add screenshots and demo videos to the README
- [ ] Prepare for VS Code Marketplace submission

## 8. Advanced Features (Future)

### Smart Search Features
- [ ] Implement "Search by example" (find similar code to selected code)
- [ ] Add "Complete this code" functionality using the search index
- [ ] Create a "Suggest refactoring" feature that identifies similar patterns

### IDE Integration
- [ ] Integrate with VS Code's existing search capabilities
- [ ] Add code navigation features based on semantic understanding
- [ ] Create a "Related code" explorer that shows semantically related files/functions
